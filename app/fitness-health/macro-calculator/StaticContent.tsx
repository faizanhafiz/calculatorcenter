          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Macronutrients are essential nutrients that provide bulk energy for the human body. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Each macronutrient plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal health and supporting various bodily functions.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                Proteins are organic compounds made up of amino acids, essential for muscle repair, growth, and hormone production. They are vital for maintaining lean body mass and overall health.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-3">
                Carbohydrates are the body's primary energy source, classified as simple (sugars) or complex (starches and fiber). They are essential for brain function and physical activity.

          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
            Your activity level significantly impacts your daily calorie needs and macronutrient requirements. The calculator uses activity multipliers to estimate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-600">
            <li>Sedentary (little or no exercise) - Multiplier: 1.2</li>
            <li>Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week) - Multiplier: 1.375</li>
            <li>Moderately active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week) - Multiplier: 1.55</li>
            <li>Very active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week) - Multiplier: 1.725</li>
            <li>Extra active (very hard exercise/job, physical job) - Multiplier: 1.9</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mt-4">
            More active individuals generally require higher calorie intake to support their energy needs, while sedentary individuals need fewer calories to maintain weight.
