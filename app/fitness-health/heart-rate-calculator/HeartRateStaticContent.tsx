      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Knowing your target heart rate zones is crucial for optimizing your workouts and achieving your fitness goals effectively. These zones represent the ideal intensity levels at which your heart should be working during physical activity to maximize cardiovascular benefits.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">What is Target Heart Rate?</h3>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Your target heart rate (THR) is the range of heartbeats per minute that you should aim for during exercise to gain the most benefits from your aerobic workout. It's based on your maximum heart rate (MHR), which is the highest number of beats your heart can achieve during maximum exertion.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        While your maximum heart rate typically decreases with age, your target heart rate zones help you gauge the effectiveness and safety of your exercise intensity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Calculating Your Zones (The Basics)</h3>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        The most common method to estimate your Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is the simple formula:
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl font-bold text-center text-purple-800 my-4">
        220 - Your Age = Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Once you have your MHR, your target heart rate zones are calculated as percentages of this maximum:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Moderate-intensity Zone:</strong> Typically 50% to 70% of your MHR. In this zone, you should be able to talk but not sing. It's excellent for building endurance and is suitable for most healthy adults.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vigorous-intensity Zone:</strong> Typically 70% to 85% of your MHR. This is a higher intensity level where you'll find it difficult to say more than a few words without pausing for breath. It's great for improving cardiovascular fitness and burning more calories in less time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Benefits of Training in Your Target Zones</h3>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        Exercising within your target heart rate zones offers a multitude of health benefits, including:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
        <li>Improved cardiovascular health and endurance</li>
        <li>More efficient calorie burning and weight management</li>
        <li>Reduced risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes</li>
        <li>Lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels</li>
        <li>Enhanced mood and reduced stress</li>
        <li>Better sleep quality</li>
        <li>Stronger bones and muscles (especially with vigorous activity)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">How to Monitor Your Heart Rate</h3>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        To ensure you're training in your desired zone, you can monitor your heart rate using several methods:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Manual Pulse Check:</strong> Place two fingers (not your thumb) on your radial artery (thumb side of your wrist) or carotid artery (side of your neck). Count your heartbeats for 15 seconds and multiply by four to get your beats per minute (BPM).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wearable Devices:</strong> Fitness trackers, smartwatches, and chest strap monitors provide real-time heart rate data, making it easier to stay in your target zone.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-purple-700 mb-3">Important Considerations & Abnormal Heartbeat</h3>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        While heart rate zones are a great guide, remember that they are estimates. Factors like your current fitness level, medications, stress, and even environmental conditions can affect your heart rate.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        It's particularly important to pay attention to your body and heart rate during exercise. If you experience an <strong className="text-red-600">abnormal heartbeat</strong>, such as a sudden flutter, skipped beats, or a racing heart that doesn't align with your exertion level, stop exercising immediately. Other warning signs include chest pain, dizziness, extreme shortness of breath, or feeling faint.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        If you frequently notice an abnormal heartbeat or any concerning symptoms, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. They can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend the safest and most effective exercise plan for your specific health condition.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-relaxed">
        For personalized advice and to determine the safest and most effective exercise plan for you, it's highly recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or a certified fitness expert.
